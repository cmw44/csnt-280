CSNT 280 Lab 1 - A simple car lot database
You are to come up with a simple database for a car lot. The entities that you will need to
keep track of are cars, customers and sales. Here are the fields you need to keep track of for
each of the tables:

cars - id, make, model, price
customers - id, first_name, last_name, sex
sales - id, car_id, customer_id

You are to come up with an appropriate SQL script called "init.sql" that will create the
tables. Next, you will use SQL Power Architect to generate an image that shows the tables and
the relationships between the tables.
